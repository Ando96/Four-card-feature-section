## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Still using flexbox

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

At first I didn't really know how to tackle the card layout but once I realised it could all be done with flexbox it all started to make sense. I will continue to work on my HTML and CSS skills working through
these challenges.

### Useful resources

- [MDN] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/- Has a lot of useful and interesting information about the different HTML and CSS tags, I find a new attribute or tag every time I'm looking for something
